# Prestige Worldwide!

Prestige Worldwide adds an event manager to Statamic! This isn't a full fledged event manager, but adds event functionality to Statamic entries. Just install the addon, select which collection to use for events, and you're good to go.

Prestige Worldwide can output a block of html for you, but it comes with a lot of tags so you can fully customize your front-end.

## Feature list

* Show a list of events with custom filters
* Adds event info to the collection you choose
* Talks to Statamic forms to count signups
* ICS & Google calendar export for each event
* And more! Check the docs for all tags and options
